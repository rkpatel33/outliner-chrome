# outliner-chrome

Creates a sidebar with a table of contents of the current page

# TODO

- style sidebar with consistent formatting (headers, links)
- build  your own header tags and populate attributes
    + links
    + identifiers
- hide/show buttons + effects -- study yinon code
    + make state persist across different link clicks in same tab?
- control viewport on clicking an element? or just use/create identifiers on page
    + this is probalby a bad idea as it will affect the original page and copying links
